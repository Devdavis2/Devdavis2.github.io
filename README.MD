<h3>About</h3>
The app features a news API, specifically linking to TechCrunch articles. Articles are updated in real-time after refreshing. The home page details in article image, headline, author and a link to read more.

<h3>Functionality</h3>
The app links to a blurb if users are interested in learning more about a specific article. The blurb is a pop up modal and links directly to the article via TechCrunch.




<h3>Unsolved Problems</h3>
The current unsolved problems are getting the modal to link directly to the selected article or having the article pop up directly in the modal. I plan on building additional functionality such as article, author, and date search. I will add more articles to the homepage as well. Maybe up to 15 articles.
